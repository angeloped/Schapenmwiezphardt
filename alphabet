In English alphabet, some letters that has similiar sound to other letters are removed, such as: Vv, Cc.
Vv has the same sound as Bb+Vv (bvah), letter Bb is has replaced to it, to make it easy to write.
And embedded to the letter Vv because people in other countries whose alphabet doesn't contain "Vv" cannot pronounce it correctly.
We can pronounce "Vv" as "Bb" instead. And also, Vv is almost similar to the sound of combination of Bb+Vv.
Жж sound is embedded to Zz, so you can make a range of sound from Zz-Zh.
